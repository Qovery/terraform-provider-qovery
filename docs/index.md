# Qovery Provider

The [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) provider is used to interact with the resources supported by Qovery. 
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used. 
It requires terraform 0.13 or later.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# Terraform 0.13+ uses the Terraform Registry:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    qovery = {
      source = "qovery/qovery"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Qovery provider
provider "qovery" {
  token = "<your-qovery-token>"
}
```
