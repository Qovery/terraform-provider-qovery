# qovery_container (Resource)

Provides a Qovery container resource. This can be used to create and manage Qovery container registry.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "qovery_container" "my_container" {
  # Required
  environment_id = qovery_environment.my_environment.id
  registry_id    = qovery_container_registry.my_container_registry.id
  name           = "MyContainer"
  image_name     = "qovery-api"
  tag            = "1.0.0"

  # Optional
  entrypoint            = "/dev/api"
  auto_preview          = "true"
  cpu                   = 500
  memory                = 512
  min_running_instances = 1
  max_running_instances = 1
  environment_variables = [
    {
      key   = "ENV_VAR_KEY"
      value = "ENV_VAR_VALUE"
    }
  ]
  secrets = [
    {
      key   = "SECRET_KEY"
      value = "SECRET_VALUE"
    }
  ]

  depends_on = [
    qovery_environment.my_environment,
    qovery_container_registry.my_container_registry
  ]
}
```
