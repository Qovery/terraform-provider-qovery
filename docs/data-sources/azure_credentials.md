# qovery_azure_credentials (Data Source)

Provides a Qovery Azure credentials data source. This can be used to read existing Qovery Azure credentials. Note: Azure credentials must be created via the Qovery console as the provisioning process requires server-side scripts.
## Example Usage
```terraform
# Azure credentials must be created via the Qovery console.
# The provisioning process requires server-side scripts that cannot be run via Terraform.
# Use this data source to reference existing Azure credentials in your Terraform configuration.

data "qovery_azure_credentials" "my_azure_creds" {
  id              = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  organization_id = qovery_organization.my_org.id
}
```
